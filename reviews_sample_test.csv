And it makes me feel very good to know I'm not jacking up my blood sugar level with sugar, and that I'm not putting sugar (which I increasingly think of as poison) into my body.  But you do have to use around the same amount as regular sugar, maybe sometimes less, sometimes more.  Various mfgs. of the product claim you can use less.

(They also eat the kitten versions of Fancy Feast wet canned food; it used to be 1 can per cat daily, but we've cut down to half a can per cat daily.  Catmium was gobbling her wet food and then eating Wolfram's, and Wolfram was letting her, preferring to eat dry food; he likes the crunchiness.  Catmium didn't need two cans a day, so now we just put out one can a day and they eat dry food if they don't get enough of the wet.)

I wanted to make some on my own, and I tried many brands and recipes, including making it from scratch.  This is the best tea I found. In my opinion, steeping tea bags makes a weak, bland tea.  You really need to use loose tea and cook it according to the directions.  I use half and half for the milk, and it makes a rich, spicy tea.  Additionally, for the sweetener, I use maple syrup instead of honey or sugar.  It might sound odd, but the maple syrup blends with the chai spices much better.
